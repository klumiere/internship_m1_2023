### To have qualimap output after the mapping###

After having the bam file from the mapping on Neo, we have to run qualimap but the input should have been sorted and we need only reads which map.

Run successively the 3 command lines on neo/genotoul or via a script on neo/genotoul (run_qm_s1_GXXX.sh, run_qm_s2_GXXX.sh and run_qm_s3_GXXX.sh):


samtools view -F 4  -b nonrRNA.GXXX.bam > GXXX_mp.bam

samtools sort GXXX_mp.bam -o GXXX_mp_s.bam


qualimap bamqc -bam GXXX_mp_s.bam -outdir qualimap_results_GXXX

The output genome_results.txt in the folder qualimap_results can be used for the PCA after.
